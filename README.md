# check_mk-mounts_layout
A Check_MK plugin for checking for the presence of defined mountpoints

The check basically parses the mounts, nfsmounts and cifsmounts section of the standard check_mk_agent.
It compares the found mountpoints against defined mountpoints (thresholds). If a defined threshold is missing
in a the agent output an alert is thrown.

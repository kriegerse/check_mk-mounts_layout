description:
  This check allows to monitor the presence of defined block device mountpoints
  on a host. 
   
  If thresholds are defined and all are found for the specific mount type, 
  the check will be in state {OK} with a message "all defined mounts found"

  If a mountpoint is defined as threshold but is not present in the corresponding 
  mounts, nfsmounts or cifsmounts section of the agent output a {CRIT} alert is thrown.

  If no mountpoints are defined as threshold but mounts are present in the agent section
  of mounts, nfsmounts or cifsmounts the check will be in state {OK} with the message
  "found mountpoints but none defined to monitor"

  If no mountpoints are defines as thresholds and also no mounts are present in 
  the agent section of mounts, nfsmounts or cifsmounts, the check will be in state
  {OK} with the message "no mounts found"

inventory:
  This check yields for each sections mounts, nfsmounts, cifsmounts 
  of the check_mk_agent output, even if no mounts are found because
  of the nature of the check logic
